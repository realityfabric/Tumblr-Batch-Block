# Tumblr Batch Block

This extension allows you to block many Tumblr bloggers at a time, and save time doing it. You can input lists you've created yourself, or use lists others have created and shared with you.

## Installation

1. Install Tumblr Batch Block ([Chrome Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumblr-batch-block/kojokoeagiinigcjnggifldgdphhpedh).)

2. Navigate to your [settings page](https://tumblr.com/settings/blog) on Tumblr. (The link will take you to your main blog. You can run the extension from any of your blogs' settings pages.)

3. Click the extension icon. There will be a pop-up box.

4. Click "Block the List".

5. Enter a comma separated list of blog names (eg "staff, testblog, gettingblocked", sans quotation marks).

5. Leave the tab open until the extension has run through the entire list. You can switch tabs and continue surfing the web while it works.
